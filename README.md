# Stats Of Legends

In this repository, we will develop an application to collect data provided in the [RIOT games API](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and provide relevant information to the user.

A user will be able to introduce a `summoner name` and the app will return information about the last games played by that user, providing tips to improve its performance in future games.
